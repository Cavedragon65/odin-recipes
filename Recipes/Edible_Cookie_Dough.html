    <p>This edible cookie dough recipe is egg-free and will satisfy any cravings for chocolate chip cookies without the wait. I have made this with friends before and they said that they loved the taste. So do I. The leftovers will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h1>What Makes This Cookie Dough Edible? </h1>
    <p>Traditional cookie dough is unsafe to consume before its baked because of the presence of eggs and raw flour. This recipe doesnt contain eggs at all, but it does contain all-purpose flour — that’s why it’s important to heat-treat the flour (cook it at a high temperature to kill the dangerous bacteria) before you incorporate it into the dough. </p>

    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    
    <h3>Edible Cookie Dough Ingredients</h3>
    <p>You likely already have most of the ingredients youll need for edible cookie dough on hand: </p>

    <ul><strong>Brown Sugar:</strong>Brown sugar lends a sweet, warm flavor. </ul>
    <ul><strong>Butter:</strong>Beat the brown sugar with a stick of butter. </ul>
    <ul><strong>Vanilla:</strong>Vanilla extract enhances the flavor of the edible cookie dough. </ul>
    <ul><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it wont make the edible cookie dough taste salty. </ul>
    <ul><strong>Milk:</strong> Milk adds moisture and helps create the perfect texture. </ul>
    <ul><strong>Chocolate Chips:</strong> Use a blend of semisweet and mini chocolate chips for the perfect cookie dough experience. </ul>
