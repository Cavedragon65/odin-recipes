    <p>These lemon scones with a sweet lemon glaze are so delicious —they melt in your mouth! This recipe came about after much trial and error as I tried to create the amazing scones I used to get in a bakery back home. I think I've got it right!</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</H1>
    <ul>3 cups all-purpose flour </ul>
    <ul>⅓ cup white sugar </ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoons baking powder </ul>
    <ul> ½ teaspoons baking soda </ul>
    <ul>⅓ teaspoon salt </ul>
    <ul>¾ cup cold butter, cut into pieces  </ul>
    <ul>9 tablespoons milk </ul>
    <ul>3 tablespoons lemon juice </ul>
    <ul>2 ½ teaspoons lemon zest </ul>
    <ul> 1 ½ teaspoons vinegar </ul>
    
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Make the scones: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk milk, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vinegar in a small bowl; stir into flour mixture until dough is moistened.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, 5 or 6 turns. Pat or roll dough out into a 1-inch-thick round. Cut into 10 wedge-shaped pieces; arrange 1 inch apart on a baking sheet.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until bottom edges are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool scones on a wire rack for 15 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, make the glaze: Stir confectioners' sugar, melted butter, lemon juice, and vanilla together in a bowl until smooth. Stir water into sugar mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, to make a glaze; drizzle glaze over warm scones.</p>
